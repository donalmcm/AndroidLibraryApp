# AndriodLibraryApp

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a RESTful web service and an Android app which uses the service.

This RESTful service should provide GET operation(s) to retrieve/query/search data in a database table. 
This web service is implemented using ASP.Net Core in C#. It will be deployed on Azure.
The data will be stored in a SQL Azure database and retrieved by the service operation as required. 
The Entity framework will be used with a code first approach to manage data in the database. 

The Android app will consume the web service. Internationalization of the app into another language will be one feature.
Expresso tests will be used to do end to end testing of the app.
